# Best Practices for Angular Development

## Analytics & Monitoring

- Google Analytics: Integrates easily with Firebase for tracking user behavior,
  page views, and conversions. You can monitor how users interact with your app.
- Firebase Analytics: Built-in with Firebase, this helps you track user
  engagement, custom events, and performance without needing to add additional
  services.
- Sentry: For error monitoring and reporting, Sentry helps track performance and
  log errors from Angular apps.
- LogRocket: Allows you to record user sessions and track bugs or UI issues,
  giving you insights into real-time user experience.

## Code Quality & Linting

- ESLint: For static code analysis and linting. It helps enforce coding
  standards and catches potential issues in your code before they become bigger
  problems.

## Performance Optimization

- Lighthouse: Google’s Lighthouse tool helps analyze your app's performance,
  accessibility, and best practices. It provides actionable feedback to improve
  load times, SEO, and more.
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer: A tool for visualizing the size of Webpack output
  files, helping you optimize and reduce the bundle size of your Angular app.
- Firebase Performance Monitoring: Built into Firebase, it helps monitor your
  app’s performance in real-time, including network requests, response times,
  and slow pages.

## Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

- GitHub Actions: Automates testing, building, and deploying Angular apps. You
  can integrate it with Firebase for automatic deployments.
- CircleCI/Travis CI: Another set of tools for automating testing and deployment
  pipelines, ensuring that your app is tested and deployed seamlessly after each
  commit.

## Code Management

- Husky + Commitlint: To enforce better commit message conventions and automate
  tasks like testing or linting before committing code.
- Swagger: If you are working with APIs (even Firebase functions), Swagger helps
  document your APIs and makes them easier to maintain and test.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

- You can turn your Angular app into a PWA for offline functionality, better
  performance, and user engagement by following Google's PWA guidelines.
- Service Workers: Use service workers with Angular to cache resources and
  improve app performance, especially in low-network conditions.
